# PRSV Severity Classification with Raspberry Pi Deployment

This project presents a deep learning-based solution for Papaya Ringspot Virus (PRSV) severity classification, integrated into a real-time hardware system using Raspberry Pi 5. The system leverages CNN models to classify papaya leaf images based on severity levels, ultimately aiding in efficient field diagnosis and disease monitoring.

ðŸ“Œ Highlights
Dataset: 3,000 augmented and balanced RGB images (256x256 resolution), labeled based on a 5-level severity scale as defined by Alviar et al., 2012.

Models Tested: Various CNN architectures including InceptionV3 and EfficientNet variants.

Top Performer: EfficientNetLite outperformed all tested models with:

Recall: 88.75%

Precision: 89.44%

Accuracy: 88.71%

F1-score: 88.85%

Deployment: Optimized and deployed on Raspberry Pi 5 for real-time inference with responsive UI display and field-ready performance.
